# Responsive Web Design Project

This is a responsive web design project. The project is assigned to four members. The motive of this project is to get all the members working as a team and learn how things are done in a team.

## Instructions for collaborators

- Clone the project and create a new branch out of `develop` that should be named as  `<your initials>-<name of section you are assigned>` e.g. `SC-footer`.
- Do not make any changes in `master` or `develop`.
- Do not send PR's to `master`, send them to `develop`.
- Follow `mobile-first` approach to design the website.
- Keep the `classnames` meaningful and avoid classname conflicts in CSS and write reuseable code.
- In case of merge conflicts, compare your branch with `develop` and `pull` if necessary.
